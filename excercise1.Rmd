## Sampling of a log-normal distribution
The following code demonstrates how a sample can be drawn from a log-normal distribution:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
s <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

### Graphical anlaysis of the sample
The following figure illustrates the distribution of the sample:
```{r}
hist(s, main = "Histogram of the sample")
```

The following figure illustrates the distribution of the log-scaled sample:
```{r}
hist(log(s), main = "Histogram of the log-scaled sample")
```

### Key figures of the sample
The mean and the variance of the sample are equal to `r mean(s)` respectively `r var(s)`.
